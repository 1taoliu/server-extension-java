# sever-extension-java
Server extensions allow developers to change and extend the capabilities of ArcGIS Server map and 
image services. This repository provides a template intended to bootstrap the development of both types of Java-based 
server extensions, server object extensions (SOEs) and server object interceptors (SOEs). It also includes two REST-based
examples, a simple row-level security filter SOI and an SOE for server-clustering. In general, this project focuses on 
REST server extensions.

## Features
* Maven project template - A template project you can fork and clone for developing your own server extensions
* Boilerplate code - Commonly used glue-code to connect custom business logic with the GIS Server framework
* Simple row-level security filter - An example SOI for implementing row-level access control for query operations 
* Server-side clustering - An example SOE for clustering point data server-side 

## Instructions
1. Fork and then clone the repo. 
2. Run and try the examples.

## Requirements
* ArcGIS Enterprise (ArcGIS Server) 10.5
* ArcGIS Desktop 10.5
* ArcObjects SDK for Java 10.5
* Java 8 Development Environment
